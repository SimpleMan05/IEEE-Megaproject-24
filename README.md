## Team Details

### Team Name:
**AB**

### Team Members:
- Amisha Krishna Gupta  
- Nikishaa Rama Gupta  

## Domain of Your Project
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

## Idea
The project aims to analyze the Ganga river water quality using AI and provide agriculture-related recommendations based on water quality parameters. It predicts critical water quality indicators and suggests suitable crops for sustainable farming practices based on real-time data.

## Achievements Thus Far
- Developed an initial model for water quality analysis.
- Integrated machine learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters.
- Identified key agriculture recommendations based on water quality data.

## How to Execute Your Code Sample
1. Clone the repository to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amisha-Krishna-29/IEEE-Megaproject-24

## Overview  
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze Ganga river water quality and provide agriculture-related recommendations.  
The system predicts key water quality parameters such as:  
- **pH**  
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**  
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**  
- **Total Suspended Solids (TSS)**  

Based on these predictions, it recommends suitable crops tailored to water quality and soil conditions, ensuring sustainable farming practices.
